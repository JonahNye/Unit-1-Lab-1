# Unit-1-Lab-1
Grand Circus Coding Boot-camp Unit 1

This project shows my baby steps taken in HTML and CSS before the coding bootcamp began. Admitance into the program depended upon completing this assignment. It is not pretty to be sure, but it was my first project outside of Codecademy. It was largely up to me alone to make this basic assignment happen.
